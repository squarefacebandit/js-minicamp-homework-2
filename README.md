# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for` = a block of code that continuously repeats itself while a specific condition is true.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` = operators for boolean logic. They are used in conjunction with conditionals in statements like while(conditional) and if(conditional) to help specify certain conditions. && means 'and', || means 'or', and ! means 'not'.
	* Arrays = a list of variables linked together under one variable. Each variable in the Array can be accessed with an index corresponding to each position in the Array. Arrays are very closely related to Objects, but use an index instead of a key
	* Git = a revision control system widely used to track codebase progression
	* GitHub = a website that hosts git repositories along side a friendly web interface.


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`


4. Make the tests pass!
